    "### Homwork Problems (in Kotlin)\n",
    "Now, let's apply what you've learned by solving some homework problems in Kotlin. These problems will test your understanding of the basic concepts of electricity. Here are three problems for you to work on:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1: Calculate Resistance**  \n",
    "Write a Kotlin program that calculates the resistance (in ohms) of a resistor using Ohm's law. The program should take the voltage (V) and current (I) as inputs and calculate the resistance (R). Use the formula: R = V / I.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2: Power Consumption**  \n",
    "Create a Kotlin program that calculates the power consumed by an electrical device. Take the voltage (V) and current (I) as inputs, and calculate the power (P) in watts. Use the formula: P = V * I.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 3: Series and Parallel Resistors**  \n",
    "Write a Kotlin program that calculates the equivalent resistance of resistors connected in series and in parallel. The program should take a list of resistor values and their connection type as input and output the equivalent resistance. You can use the formulas for series and parallel resistors:\n",
    "\n",
    "For series resistors: Req = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...\n",
    "For parallel resistors: 1 / Req = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + ..."
