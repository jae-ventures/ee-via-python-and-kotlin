    "\n",
    "**Problem 1: Calculate Resistance**  \n",
    "Write a Kotlin program that calculates the resistance (in ohms) of a resistor using Ohm's law. The program should take the voltage (V) and current (I) as inputs and calculate the resistance (R). Use the formula: R = V / I.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2: Power Consumption**  \n",
    "Create a Kotlin program that calculates the power consumed by an electrical device. Take the voltage (V) and current (I) as inputs, and calculate the power (P) in watts. Use the formula: P = V * I.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 3: Series and Parallel Resistors**  \n",
    "Write a Kotlin program that calculates the equivalent resistance of resistors connected in series and in parallel. The program should take a list of resistor values and their connection type as input and output the equivalent resistance. You can use the formulas for series and parallel resistors:\n",
    "\n",
    "For series resistors: Req = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...\n",
    "For parallel resistors: 1 / Req = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + ..."
